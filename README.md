# Octopress Snippets
This is a [Sublime Text][sublime] package which includes a bunch of handy snippets for doing Octopress framework development.

## Installation

### With Package Control

If you have the [Package Control][package_control] package installed, you can install Octopress framework Snippets from inside Sublime Text itself.

- Open the Command Palette or `(Ctrl + Shift) + P`

### Without Package Control
